## **Description**:
`MUSIAL IVE` is a companion tool for [`MUSIAL`](https://github.com/Integrative-Transcriptomics/MUSIAL) and offers a web-based novel and unique interactive visualization of single nucleotide and structural variants that were identified for a single gene and allocated to a reference protein structure of this gene using `MUSIAL`.

---
## **Access**:
The tool is available via GitHub pages at [https://integrative-transcriptomics.github.io/MUSIAL-IVE/](https://integrative-transcriptomics.github.io/MUSIAL-IVE/
).

## **Usage**:
The starting page of the tool offers a panel to add features at the top. Features have to be loaded from a `VDict JSON` file generated with `MUSIAL v2.1`.
